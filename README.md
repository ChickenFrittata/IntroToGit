Intro to Github

A short proof of concept for Unity and Github


Instructions:

Sign up to github.com and request to be added to the group ChickenFrittata

Download GitHub for Desktop at https://desktop.github.com

Open GitHub for Desktop and connect it with your GitHub account.

Click the + button and "clone" the IntroToGit repository under the ChickenFrittata organization. Save it in the location you want to save your Unity Projects.

Click the dropdown that says "master â–¼" and switch to the "Working" branch. Then click the Sync button. This will move files from GitHub to your computer.


Open Unity, and under "Open", navigate to the directory you specified in the last step.
Unity will rebuild some files and then open the demo project.

Open Scene 1 in the Assets folder. Feel free to play around, add objects or more text to the scene, your choice.

When you're finished, save the project and close Unity.

Changes you've made are automatically monitored by the GitHub client. Type in a short summary of the changes you've made, then
click commit to "Working" to push those changes to the branch. After a few minutes, your changes will be available for everyone
to see and work on.

Things to keep in mind while using GIT:
Make sure you're working in the "Working" branch, not master.
Always sync before you open the project in Unity to make sure you're up-to-date. Otherwise, you'll get merge errors and may have to undo all your work.
Ask questions in the Discord. We're all complete beginners to this.

We may end up using something else in the end. C'est le vie.
