# IntroToGit
Intro to Github

A short proof of concept for Unity and Github


Instructions:

Sign up to github.com and request to be added to the group ChickenFrittata

Download GitHub for Desktop at https://desktop.github.com

Open GitHub for Desktop and connect it with your GitHub account.

Click the + button and "clone" the IntroToGit repository under the ChickenFrittata organization. Save it in the location you want to save your Unity Projects.

Click the dropdown that says "master â–¼" and switch to the "Initial-Commit" branch. Then click the Sync button. This will move files from GitHub to your computer.


Open Unity, and under "Open", navigate to the directory you specified in the last step.
Unity will rebuild some files and then open the demo project.

Open Scene 1 in the Assets folder. Feel free to play around, add objects or more text to the scene, your choice.

When you're finished, save the project and close Unity.

Changes you've made are automatically monitored by the GitHub client. Type in a short summary of the changes you've made, then
click commit to Initial-Commit to push those changes to the branch. After a few minutes, your changes will be available for everyone
to see and work on.
